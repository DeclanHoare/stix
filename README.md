# stix
stix is an InstallShield 3 extractor created by Veit Kannegieser.
This version has been modified by me so that it works on Linux.

## Building

Please see the wiki page [Building](https://github.com/RogueAI42/stix/wiki/Building) for the latest instructions.

## Usage

To use stix, run:

`stix FILENAME TARGETDIRECTORY`

where FILENAME is the name of your data.z file and TARGETDIRECTORY
is the root directory where it should be extracted.

## Todo

It would be nice to be able to use stix as a backend to extract data.z
files in graphical archiving tools.
